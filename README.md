HTML validators
An HTML validator is a quality-assurance tool that can detect common syntax errors such as extra spaces, open tags, or missing quotation marks. These syntax errors could cause a page to render correctly in one browser but not in another. You can use an HTML validator to automatically verify your HTML page for syntax errors. You can then correct any coding mistakes identified by the validator program.
